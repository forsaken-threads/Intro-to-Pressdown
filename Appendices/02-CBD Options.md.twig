    h:
        1: Option
        2: Description
    r:
        1: `-final`
        2: This will prevent further processing of the block.  Some Pressdown processing will occur even with this option.
    r:
        1: `-md`
        2: This will prevent further Markdown processing of the block.
    r:
        1: `-nw`
        2: This will prevent all wrapping of the block.  Good for keeping code snippets in one line.
    r:
        1: `-p`
        2: This will strip all Markdown `p` tags from the block using this regex: `/<\/?p>/`.
    r:
        1: `+w`
        2: The default action is to trim whitespace from the contents.  This will prevent that from happening.
